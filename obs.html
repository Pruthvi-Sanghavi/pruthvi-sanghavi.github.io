        <b>Abstract:</b>
        </br>&#8594; Conventionally large metal oxygen tanks weighing tens of kilograms are used as apparatus for breathing underwater which decreases the diving time and restricts us
                     from exploring the deeper parts of the sea for a longer period of time. Considering this thesis, this particular research develops an underwater breathing system which is designed
                     based on fish gills. This approach uses the principle of counterflow diffusion to extract dissolved oxygen from surrounding water and supply it directly to the deoxygenated
                     blood coming from the body, eliminating the gas phase in between. A hypothetical system is developed based on the solution provided below. This paper specifically deals with the
                     concept and the mathematical formulations of the phenomena that would be used in the development of this device.
        </br><b>Introduction</b>
        </br>&#8594; The current methods for breathing underwater uses old conventional designs which greatly reduce our productivity.
                     Existing conventional methods of breathing underwater can be divided into two types: Oxygen tanks and surface
                     supplied method. These methods have some limitations like less diving time and large weight. Development of new
                     methods of underwater breathing is therefore required. The Oxygen present in atmosphere gets dissolved in water
                     because of the its partial pressure [1] which can be used for breathing underwater. To extract this oxygen, diffusion  
                     process is used. Diffusion is mass transfer phenomenon which induces the flow of mass due to concentration
                     difference. The proposed system uses this very principle for exchange of gases between blood and water.
                     The contents of our research are distributed in the paper as follows: Section I describes introduction, Section II
                     describes the core concept, Section III deals with the mathematical model, Section IV explains the design aspects
                     of the device, Section V describes our hypothetical setup, Section VI sheds light on our future plans for the device.
        </br><b>Core Concept</b>
        </br>&#8594; Our system closely mimics the natural structure of fish gills.
                    fish uses the phenomena of counterflow diffusion to absorb
                     oxygen from surrounding water; water flows over the gills
                      and passes through the structure called primary lamellae [2],
                     which consists of sub-structures called secondary lamellae,
                      this is where the diffusion happens. The concentration of
                      oxygen and carbon dioxide [3][4] dissolved in water
                    depends upon the partial pressure gradient of gases between
                    water and atmosphere. Now as the blood and water move in
                    counter current direction in the gills; blood in lamellae and
                      water over it, a partial pressure gradient exist between the
                    deoxygenated blood and oxygen rich water. This results in
                    the diffusion of oxygen into the blood from water. Carbon
                    dioxide on the other hand diffuses from blood into the water
                    because of its high concentration in blood as compared to
                    water [5]. This is how a fish gill works.
                    The countercurrent flow of blood and water has a reason.
                    Suppose if the blood in the gills and water around it moved
                    in the same direction in the fish gills, that is if they flowed
                    parallel to each other, then the gas exchange occurs until
                    their concentration became equal, since after that no partial
                    pressure gradient exists, no diffusion occurs.
