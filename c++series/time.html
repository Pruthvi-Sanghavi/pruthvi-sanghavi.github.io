     Time machine in layman’s terms is a device which takes us to the past or the future. Although this definition is simple, we need to probe into the meanings of the words past and the future to check the validity of these concepts.</b>
     From relativity, we know that there are 4 dimensions (11 from string theory but that’s a subject of another discussion) three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. Out of these 4 dimensions we have a hold on the spatial dimensions like we can move forward and backward in space, the x, y and z directions but time only flows in one direction. 
     One cannot reverse the direction of time. The other way to say this is that the entropy of a system always increases. Time can possibly only move in the reverse order only during the event of a big crunch (when the universe contracts instead of expanding and during that all your life events will occur in a reverse order - that is first you will grow old and then younger.)</br>
     Though moving in the future is possible because the time already flows in that direction and we are already moving in the future. That means we are already travelling on a one way time machine and we have travelled through our past. All the past events that we travelled through are stored in our memories. We can easily remember some events which occurred to us and others in the recent past and some prominent events from our far past. As we move forward in our future, the memory of the far past diminishes since our brains have limited data storage capacity (if you are not Lucy). Our brains are developed through evolution and it will take a long time to evolve them to have infinite memory and work at full capacity. Computers also store data and have memories. We can have a computer that can store infinite memory.  
     Each individual’s past is every event she lived and those events are stored as data in our memory. Potentially building a computer with an infinite memory can be used to store data about each organism’s past on this earth. A lot of disorganized information which can be structured using unsupervised machine learning and a mapping of the past can be created which our time machines can travel through using technologies such as AR/VR. 
     </br>Now, from the above discussion we can say that we have opened a gateway to the past that we can travel using the machines of infinite memory which I call computers for now. But the question is can we change the paste? Can we change the events we already live with and can we change the events which are going to happen to us in the future?
     </br>I think there is possibly no way that we can use to change the events that took place in the past. But I have a theory which can be used to change the future. I will present that theory with the following. 
     </br>Here we will start with a very simple example. Suppose that you are a very simple organism and you have only 5 things to do in the future (Normal humans might have countless things to do). Each thing here is something you will either fail or succeed at. Mathematically speaking each of these events have a probability distribution (which are random, may be normal, may be uniform or maybe some other type we don't know). Graphically it can be shown as following <b>[INSERT FIGURE]</b></br>
     This is the place machine learning models and computers come in. First we need to know a function that gives us the probability of failure or success of a future event by learning from all the past events stored in our computer using unsupervised learning. But one could ask here that if we have found the mapping from the past events to the future events then how can one change the future? Here comes the juicy part. Using Inverse mapping (the inverse of our nonlinear function) which we defined above using unsupervised learning helps us do the trick and change our future. Imagine that for a particular event out of the 5 things defined above we assume a very high probability of success for that event. Finding the inverse of that probability distribution can help us find the list of events performing which we can change the future. So welcome to your successful future. 
     The trick here in the above argument is finding that nonlinear function which is extremely difficult and I would assume that it is equivalent to coming up with the grand unified theory)
     So what can we do to change the future? Make good decisions, work hard and work smart. These things can change the probability distribution and in fact every infinitesimally small moment after this moment is the future and the transition from that infinitesimally small moment and that next infinitesimally small event is called Life.
