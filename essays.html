    <h3>Why you should learn coding?</h3>
    <p>An epiphany stuck me today which is "everyone should learn to code" and here is why.
    So, first of all we know that to learn a concept yourself it is better to teach someone as it
    helps in understanding the concept better and finding out the gaps in knowledge.
   But you cant always have a person to teach you at your availability, but you have that one thing 
    always lying on your desk which understands the concepts you explain to it but in a very specific form which we call the programming language.
    I would say with proper set of instructions supplied to it the computers are the dumbest thing even dumber than an animals.
