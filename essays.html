    <h3>Why you should learn coding?</h3>
    <p><i>Written by - Pruthvi S. and ChatGPT</i>
     
I recently had an epiphany: everyone should learn how to code and program, and there's a specific rationale behind it. Firstly, we often emphasize that in order to grasp a concept or absorb knowledge, whether it pertains to finance, science, economics, politics, or any subject of study, explaining it to someone else enhances our understanding. This principle aligns with Richard Feynman's perspective that if you can't teach a concept, you might not fully comprehend it yourself. Now, while you might not always have a person available to teach in front of you, there's a constant resource on your desk: your computer.

I'd argue that computers are currently among the least intelligent entities we possess. They are even less capable than many organisms on Earth. They lack innate learning abilities. Despite the existence of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which imbue computers with the capacity to think and make predictions based on pattern recognition, computers inherently lack the capability to learn independently.

However, by acquiring coding skills, any concept you understand can be readily translated into a code and communicated to a computer. When the computer comprehends the input, processes it effectively, and produces an output matching your hypothesized or predicted result, it signifies a profound grasp of the concept. This perspective shapes my belief that learning programming languages, whether it's C++, C, Python, C#, Assembly language, or any other, holds significant value.

In conclusion, my viewpoint is that learning programming languages can enhance your understanding of various subjects and concepts. It provides a pathway to effectively communicate and test your comprehension by interacting with computers.
